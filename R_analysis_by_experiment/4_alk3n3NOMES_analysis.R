# DESCRIPTION ####
# The following code ASSUMES all dependencies in R  have been installed and previous R code have been run successfully see file(s): 
# 1_environment_setup.R 
# 2_alk3n3_seurat_setup.R

# The purpose of this code is to analyze n=3 data which has been subsetted to remove mesenchymal cells, as a Seurat object.

# R v3.5.3 (x64 bit) and RStudio v1.2.1335 (x64 bit) were used for running this code (see readme on how to install)
# Seurat is a multimodal single Cell RNA seq analysis algorithm created by
# The Satija Lab. For more information please see: https://satijalab.org/seurat/

# In order to get the same distribution of UMAP coordinates as that shown in Qadir et al., 2020: PNAS please use
# the following uwot version: uwot_0.1.4.tar.gz	2019-09-23 10:20	79K
